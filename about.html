      I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology degree with a specialization in Computer Science & Engineering. 

      I am excited to kick-start my career in the IT industry. My passion for programming has driven me to excel in various
      languages and frameworks such as Java, JDBC, Hibernate, Spring(MVC,IOC, BOOT), HTML-5, CSS-3, and JavaScript.
      
      Additionally, I have developed practical skills in the database management system using SQL commands.

      Moreover, during my studies, I developed a passion and I have acquired expertise in front-end development by designing
      and developing web pages using HTML-5, CSS-3, and JavaScript.

      In addition to my technical skills, I possess excellent communication and teamwork abilities, which I have learned
      through group projects and presentations.
